# Who is BGP?
BGP is the leader, or "master" in the words of their staff, of a 2b2t group called... well.. 2b2t.group... Very original

# How did I get in contact with BGP?
I started contact with BGP trying to join their group, when they started sending slightly sexually explicit messages to me, and I let them know that I in fact was a minor, to which they didn't care

# What did BGP do?
Lots of stuff, but I will get into the main issues. I exposed one of BGPs staff, Laura (aka caec64), for asking a minor, who was 16, for nudes. After I did this, BGP started calling me, a 15 year old, a pedophile, and when I asked why, their only response was that I was a "monster". Later on, BGP claimed to be dating a minor known as Mito, who had also called out BGP for being a pedophile. BGP also said that they are "dating mito", "only did it (pedophilic actions) with mito", and that "age doesn't matter".
There is a LOT more to this but I will just provide screenshots.
